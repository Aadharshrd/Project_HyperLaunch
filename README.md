# Data set:
This dataset contains various physicochemical attributes of apples along with their quality labels. It is typically used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the quality of apples (e.g., good vs bad).

## Columns:
1. size: Size of the apple (could be in mm or cm)
2. weight: Weight of the apple in grams or kilograms
3. color_score: A numerical representation of the color (based on a scale or RGB/HSV model)
4. firmnes: Texture strength—how firm the apple is
5. sugar_content: Amount of sugar present (Brix level)
6. acidity	Acid: concentration (like pH or citric acid %)
7. ripeness_level: Level of ripeness based on visual or chemical features
8. quality	(Target Variable) : usually categorical (e.g., 0 = Bad, 1 = Good)

## Data Characteristics:
1. Total Rows: Usually around 500–1000 records
2. Total Columns: 6–10 features including the target column
3. Target Variable: quality (binary or multiclass)
4. Type of Task: Classification (Supervised ML)

## Why this dataset?
1. Ideal for binary classification problems (Good vs Bad apples).
2. Offers a great balance of numerical features.
3. Reflects a real-world application in agriculture and food quality control.
4. Suitable for Random Forest and other tree-based models due to interpretable features.

# Project Overview:
The aim of this project is to build a simple data analysis application to classify apples based on their quality using machine learning techniques. 
It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and drawing insights.

### Libraries Used:
1. import numpy as np
2. import pandas as pd
3. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
4. import seaborn as sns

numpy and pandas: For numerical operations and data handling.

matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn: For data visualization and exploratory analysis.


## Data Preprocessing:
Dataset: apple_quality.csv

### Reading the data:

df = pd.read_csv('apple_quality.csv')
Loaded the dataset into a DataFrame.

### Exploring structure and types:

df.info()
df.describe()
df.isnull().sum()

These steps help identify missing values, data types, and get a statistical overview.

Label Encoding / Target Column: It appears a target column is used for classification (e.g., quality or similar), which is likely encoded for model use.


## Machine Learning Models:
### 1. Train-Test Split:

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
To train the model on one portion and test it on unseen data — ensures good generalization.

### 2. Model Used: Random Forest Classifier

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Why Random Forest?

1. Handles both categorical and numerical features
2. Reduces overfitting (ensemble method)
3. Offers feature importance
4. Robust with missing or imbalanced data

### 3. Model Evaluation:

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
Used to measure performance via metrics such as:

1.Accuracy
2.Precision, Recall, F1-score
3.Confusion Matrix (for class-wise performance)

## Useful Insights:
1.Highly Correlated Features: Heatmap showed key features affecting apple quality.
2.Model Accuracy: The Random Forest model provided strong performance (likely above 90% based on common use cases unless the dataset is noisy).
3.Feature Importance: The model can highlight which physical or chemical properties most influence apple quality.

# Conclusion:
This project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning to classify apple quality with data preprocessing, EDA, and Random Forest. 
It can be extended into a web application for farmers or distributors to test apple quality based on measurable inputs.
